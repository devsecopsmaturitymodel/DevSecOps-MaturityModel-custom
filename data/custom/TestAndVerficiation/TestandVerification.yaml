Test and Verification:
  Dynamic depth for applications:
    Coverage of client side dynamic components:
    Coverage of hidden endpoints:
    Simple Scan:
    Usage of multiple scanners:
  Static depth for applications:
    Static analysis for important server side components:
    Test of server side components with known vulnerabilities:
      evidence: |
      The ClusterScanner scans with the OWASP Dependency Check enabled.

  Test-Intensity:
    Regular tests:
    Default settings for intensity:
  Consolidation:
    Advanced visualization of defects:
      evidence: The current security status is visualized in OWASP DefectDojo.
    Simple false positive treatment:
      evidence: Via OWASP DefectDojo, ![ClusterScannerFindings](assets/evidence-images/defectdojo.png)
    Usage of a vulnerability management system:
      evidence: |
        OWASP DefectDojo is used

  Dynamic depth for infrastructure:
    Load tests:
    Test of the configuration of cloud environments:
    Test for exposed services:
  Static depth for infrastructure:
    Test cluster deployment resources:
    Test the cloud configuration:
    Check for image lifetime:
      evidence: |
        The ClusterScanner is configured to report too old images depending on the project configuration.
